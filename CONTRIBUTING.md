# Contributing to CRLSTime

Thank you for your interest! Before you contribute, we would like you to know the following things:

## License

By contributing to this project, you are granting full rights over your contributions under copyright to the Cambridge Rindge and Latin School Computer Science Club (hereinafter "CRLS CS Club"). This means that the CRLS CS Club is within its legal rights to use your contributions in any manner without attributing you, if you contribute code to this project.

## Code style

This project follows the [Stoustrup style](http://www.stroustrup.com/Programming/PPP-style-rev3.pdf), with 2 spaces for indentation. It is recommended to read the hyperlinked style guide before contributing code, so that your code will be consistent with preexisting code. The code samples in the style guide are written in C++, but the same general principles apply to JavaScript. Here are some examples of the Stoustrup style with 2 spaces for indentation:

```js
if (a == b) {
  doSomething();
}
else if (a == 2) {
  doSomethingElse();
}
else {
  document.getElementById("subscribeBtn").addEventListener("click", function() {
    alert("hello");
  });
}

for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  console.log("hello");
}
```
