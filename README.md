# CRLSTime
A clock for showing the CRLS schedule during the school day

*This branch is not stable, nor is it actively developed. The purpose of this branch is to house a snapshot of the `testing` branch so that people can easily see if my code works when I submit a pull request to [CRLSCSClub/CRLSTime](https://github.com/CRLSCSClub/CRLSTime), the main repository. If you are looking for my latest changes, please go to the `testing` branch of this repository. If you are looking for the stable version of CRLSTime, please go to [CRLSCSClub/CRLSTime](https://github.com/CRLSCSClub/CRLSTime).*
