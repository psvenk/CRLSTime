# CRLSTime

A clock for showing the CRLS schedule during the school day

*This branch is not stable. The purpose of this branch is to house the other branches of my fork of CRLSTime (for publishing to GitHub Pages) so that other people can easily see if my code works when I submit a pull request to [CRLSCSClub/CRLSTime](https://github.com/CRLSCSClub/CRLSTime), the main repository. If you are looking for my latest changes, please go to the `testing` branch of this repository. If you are looking for the stable version of CRLSTime, please go to [CRLSCSClub/CRLSTime](https://github.com/CRLSCSClub/CRLSTime).*
